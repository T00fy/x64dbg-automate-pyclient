# Commands and Extensibility

While x64dbg Automate strives to provide an idiomatic and easy to understand abstraction layer on top of the command execution abilities of x64dbg, it would be foolhardy to say every feature is covered perfectly for every use case.

Raw command execution capabilities allow users to extend and customize x64dbg Automate beyond the built-in abstractions.
