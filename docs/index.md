</p>

The heart of this project is the native plugin that externalizes the bridge and scripting interfaces of x64dbg - which is the foundation on which the Python reference client for x64dbg Automate is built.

## Core Principles

- **First-class Python Support**: Bring your own interpreter to automate debug and analysis tasks.
- **Enhanced Features**: The project provides abstractions on top of debugger functionality to make common tasks easy, and pitfalls rare. 
- **Maintained/Modern Plugin and Client**: The project aims to target both the latest x64dbg and Python versions.
- **Clear Documentation**: The features of the software are easy to use and well documented.
- **Extensible**: Build your own client on the plugin's RPC interface and extend x64dbg Automate beyond Python.
