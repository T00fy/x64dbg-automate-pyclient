</p>

The heart of this project is the native plugin that externalizes the bridge and scripting interfaces of x64dbg - this is the foundation on which the Python reference client for x64dbg Automate is built.

## Core Principles

- **First-class Python Support**: Bring your own interpreter to automate debug and analysis tasks.
- **Enhanced Features**: Automate provides abstractions on top of debugger functionality for easy, concise, and reproducible scripting. 
- **Maintained/Modern Plugin and Client**: Automate aims to target both the latest x64dbg and Python versions.
- **Clear Documentation**: The features of Automate are easy to understand and well documented.
- **Extensible**: Build on top of Automate to extend its capabilities even further.

## Getting Started

To get started with x64dbg Automate, it's recommended to visit [Installation](installation.md) and [Quickstart](quickstart.md).

ðŸ”” _All examples and sample code assume x64dbg is configured to stop on entry and system breakpoints, skipping TLS breakpoints._
